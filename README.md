# Odin Library

Tapping into more DOM manipulation, CSS grid, and object construction. Not gonna lie, I'm fairly proud of this one.

## How to Use
- Books may be added by filling in the form elements and clicking submit
- Remove individual books by clicking the remove button
- Existing books may be marked as read, either on submission or after

## Major Skills Honed
- CSS Grid
  - To include item positioning and sizing. This still needs work, but there has certainly been some progress made.
- Image utilization & styling
  - Progressing towards a more modern and trendy design while maintaining a somewhat unique yet readable appearance
- Markdown language
  - Because this is the first time in a while I've put effort into this
  - I've also learned that you can preview .md files in VScode with cmd + shift + v
- Pseudo styling
- Constructor functions

## Items to Revisit Later
- Form animation
  - Hiding the form from view unless 'Submit Button' is clicked
  - I could struggle my way through this but I'd rather just continue in the course and learn animations and transformations later
- Server side storage
  - This could make it an actual useful library for me
- Ego flair
  - GitHub & LinkedIn footer
